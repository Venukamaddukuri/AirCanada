     <h4>ID Requirements</h4>
    <p> It is your responsibility to ensure that you - and any child travelling with you - have all the valid travel documents necessary to enter in, exit from or transit through, each country on your itinerary. Note that the documents required for the outbound portion of your travel may differ from those required for the return.</p>

<p>Along with the normal travel documents needed to enter Canada, additional documents may be required depending on your country of origin, even if they are used solely to land in Canada and re-board a connecting flight.</p>
     <h4>Passports and Visas</h4>
     <h5>Passports</h5>

<p>A valid passport is required for travel to, from and via most countries, including for return travel to Canada. If you do not have a valid passport, we strongly recommend that you apply for one well in advance of travel.

<p>Some countries require that your passport be valid for three or six months beyond your date of return. Visit the IATA Travel CentreOpens in New WindowExternal site which may not meet accessibility guidelines. or Travel and Tourism CanadaOpens in New WindowExternal site which may not meet accessibility guidelines. to determine whether the three- or six-month rule applies to your destination(s).</p>

<p>Passports must be in good condition: passports damaged beyond normal wear and tear will not be accepted. Examples of damage to a passport may be found on the Canadian Passport ProgramOpens in New WindowExternal site which may not meet accessibility guidelines. website. If you are concerned about the condition of your passport, contact the Canadian Passport ProgramOpens in New WindowExternal site which may not meet accessibility guidelines. or the appropriate embassy, high commission or consulate to get a new passport.</p>
  <h4>Entry and Exit Requirements</h4>
<p>On your arrival in a foreign country, be prepared to prove that you have sufficient funds to support yourself during your intended stay and that you will be admitted to the next country on your itinerary. For example, have a visa for that country if it is required. Many countries will grant entry only if you are in possession of a return or onward ticket.</p>

<p>Some countries impose exit controls, which may include exit permits, proof of payment of local taxes if applicable, payment or sometimes very costly fines for visa overstays. In some countries, you must register with local authorities if you are not staying at a recognized hotel. Otherwise, your departure may be delayed, or you may be fined when you leave.  </p> 
  <h4>Travel Documents for Children</h4>
  <h5>Passports</h5>
<p>For travel to countries where a passport is required, all Canadians, including children, must carry their own passport. Canada does not allow children to travel on their parent's passport.

<h5>Entry and Exit Requirements</h5>
<p>Prior to any international travel that includes a child, parents should visit the IATA Travel CentreExternal site which may not meet accessibility guidelines. and Travel and Tourism CanadaOpens in New WindowExternal site which may not meet accessibility guidelines., or contact the embassy high commission or consulate of all countries the child will be visiting to enquire about entry and exit requirements.

<h5>Other Travel Documents</h5>
<p>Some countries require one or more of the following documents when travelling with a child</p>

<p>The child’s birth certificate showing the names of both parents.</p>
<p>Any legal documents pertaining to custody.</p>
<p>A parental consent letter authorizing travel (if the child is travelling with one parent, the letter must be signed and dated by the other parent; if the child is travelling without his parents, the letter must be signed and dated by both parents.</p>
A death certificate if one of the parents is deceased</p>
<h5>Passport Signature for Minors Holding a Canadian Passport</h5>
<p>Parents/legal guardians must never sign their child’s Canadian passport. Signing your child’s passport will make it invalid thus the signature block on page 3 must be left blank.</p>
